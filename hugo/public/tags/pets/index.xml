      <description>A monk asked Joshu, &amp;ldquo;Has the dog the Buddha nature?&amp;rdquo; Joshu replied, &amp;ldquo;Mu&amp;rdquo;
Mumon&amp;rsquo;s Comment:  For the pursuit of Zen, you must pass through the barriers (gates) set up by the Zen masters. To attain his mysterious awareness one must completely uproot all the normal workings of one&amp;rsquo;s mind. If you do not pass through the barriers, nor uproot the normal workings of your mind, whatever you do and whatever you think is a tangle of ghost.</description>

      <description>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!”
He took his vorpal sword in hand; Long time the manxome foe he sought— So rested he by the Tumtum tree And stood awhile in thought.</description>

      <description>Nansen saw the monks of the eastern and western halls fighting over a baby cat. He seized the cat and said, &amp;ldquo;If (any of) you can say (a word of Zen), you can spare the cat. Otherwise I will kill it.&amp;rdquo; No one could answer. So Nansen cut the cat in two.
That evening Joshu returned and Nansen told him what had happened. Joshu thereupon took off his sandals and, placing them on his head, walked away.</description>
