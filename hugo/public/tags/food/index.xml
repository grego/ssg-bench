      <description>Nansen saw the monks of the eastern and western halls fighting over a baby cat. He seized the cat and said, &amp;ldquo;If (any of) you can say (a word of Zen), you can spare the cat. Otherwise I will kill it.&amp;rdquo; No one could answer. So Nansen cut the cat in two.
That evening Joshu returned and Nansen told him what had happened. Joshu thereupon took off his sandals and, placing them on his head, walked away.</description>
